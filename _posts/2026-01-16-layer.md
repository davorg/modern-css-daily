Introduced in the CSS Containment Module Level 2, the concept of "layer" in CSS became a game-changing feature for web developers, aimed at providing enhanced control over the order in which CSS rules get applied. This feature was globally discussed around 2021, and since then, has been integrated into numerous modern CSS workflows to address some of the complexities associated with specificity and the waterfall of CSS rules application.

CSS layers pertain to the @layer rule that allows you to define explicit cascading order for your stylesheets. Instead of relying purely on specificity rules and source order, which can sometimes lead to complications in large projects, CSS layers enable developers to explicitly set layers of CSS where styles can cascade from one layer to another in a controlled manner. 

Here's a simple example to demonstrate the usage of CSS layers:

```css
@layer reset, base, utilities;

@layer reset {
  * {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
  }
}

@layer base {
  body {
    font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
  }

  h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
    margin-bottom: 0.5em;
  }
}

@layer utilities {
  .text-center {
    text-align: center;
  }
}
```

In the code above, you can see that the styles are divided into three separate layers: reset, base, and utilities. The CSS rules will apply from the reset layer, through the base layer, and finally to the utilities layer. This logical sequence gives developers a clear hierarchy, making it easier to maintain and update the code.

The utility of CSS layers in today's development environment cannot be overstated. In particular, they contribute to improved style organization in large projects, making the style rules more predictable and the debugging process significantly easier. With layers, you achieve better control over the cascade without having to rewrite selectors to increase specificity or worry as much about source order, thereby promoting cleaner and more maintainable code.

However, like any new CSS feature, layers come with some considerations regarding browser support. As of late 2023, most modern browsers, including the latest versions of Chrome, Edge, Safari, and Firefox, support CSS layers. Nonetheless, older browsers or niche web operating environments may only offer partial support. As such, developers should incorporate fallbacks or use feature detection using @supports rules when adopting CSS layers in production environments to ensure a broad compatibility cushion.

In conclusion, CSS layers empower developers to better manage stylesheets, enhancing the challenge of specificity wars and promoting more maintainable codebases—an especially beneficial feature as projects scale and complexity increases.

In the ever-evolving world of web development, ensuring optimal image quality while maintaining performance can be a bit of a balancing act. CSS's "image-set()" function, introduced in the early 2010s, is a powerful tool designed to aid web developers in delivering high-quality images adapting to various screen resolutions and devices.

At its core, "image-set()" allows developers to specify multiple image resources with varying resolutions (or other criteria) for a single image property in CSS. This mechanism helps modern websites deliver the most appropriate image file for different display settings, thereby enhancing performance and visual fidelity.

The syntax for "image-set()" is straightforward, enabling you to define different images along with their descriptors, usually their pixel density, using the 'x' descriptor to specify different screen densities. Here is a basic example of how "image-set()" might be implemented:

```css
.hero-image {
  background-image: image-set(
    url("image@1x.jpg") 1x,
    url("image@2x.jpg") 2x,
    url("image@3x.jpg") 3x
  );
}
```

In this example, the browser automatically chooses the appropriate image based on the device's screen density. For instance, a device with a 2x resolution will use "image@2x.jpg", while a standard resolution screen will settle for "image@1x.jpg".

The "image-set()" function is particularly useful today as we support a range of devices with vastly different display capabilities. With more devices sporting high-resolution displays, images can appear blurry if not served at appropriate resolutions. "image-set()" is a responsive solution enabling developers to cater to varying resolution needs efficiently.

However, like many CSS features, "image-set()" has its caveats, primarily concerning browser support. While most modern browsers, including the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, support "image-set()", older versions, notably Internet Explorer, may not. It is always advisable to consider fallbacks or check compatibility tables such as those available on MDN Web Docs or Can I Use to ensure all users have a satisfactory experience.

In conclusion, "image-set()" is a valuable tool in the responsive web design toolkit. By allowing developers to specify different images for different display capabilities, it helps deliver better visual experiences without compromising performance. As web development continues to embrace high-resolution displays, utilizing features like "image-set()" becomes increasingly crucial to maintain quality and efficiency, ensuring each visitor receives the best possible browsing experience.

The CSS property "gap" has become an important tool in the developer's toolkit, particularly when working with Flexbox and Grid layouts. Introduced as part of the CSS Grid specification in 2017, it was initially available only for CSS Grid Layouts. However, with its growing popularity and utility, browser vendors extended its support to Flexbox layouts in 2020, making it an even more versatile and indispensable feature in modern web design.

At its core, the "gap" property simplifies the process of spacing out items within a container. Before its advent, developers typically had to rely on margins to create space between elements, a method which could lead to overly complex and sometimes inconsistent layouts, especially as project complexity grew. The "gap" property consolidates this capability into a single, elegant solution, allowing you to specify the space between rows and columns in a grid or the space between items in a flexible layout with a single line of CSS.

Here's how you can use it in practice:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
  gap: 20px;
}

.flex-container {
  display: flex;
  gap: 15px;
}
```

In the example above, the `.container` class is a grid layout with three columns, and a 20-pixel gap between them. Similarly, the `.flex-container` class uses Flexbox with a 15-pixel gap between each item. The "gap" property makes managing space intuitive and visually consistent without dealing with the individual margins of each child element. 

Today, "gap" remains a crucial feature because it streamlines layout design, ensuring that spacing is consistent and easy to manage across different screen sizes and components. It also enhances readability when you need to adjust the layout, as changes can be made by altering a single property rather than dealing with multiple spacing adjustments.

While "gap" is widely supported in modern browsers, there are a few caveats to keep in mind. Particularly with older versions, support in Flexbox was not consistent. Fortunately, as a result of continuous updates from major browsers, the property is now well-supported in recent versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. It's best to check the current compatibility if your audience may include users with outdated browser versions, though this is becoming less of an issue with each passing year.

In conclusion, the "gap" property is a brilliant illustration of how CSS continues to evolve to meet the needs of web developers, simplifying the process of creating beautiful, functional, and scalable web designs.

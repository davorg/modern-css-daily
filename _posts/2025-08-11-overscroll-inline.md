CSS continues to evolve, offering developers enhanced control over web page behavior and aesthetics. One of the newer, compelling features that have come into play is the `overscroll-inline` property. Introduced in the CSS Containment module, `overscroll-inline` allows developers to handle overscroll behavior specifically in the inline-axis. This feature became part of CSS with its inclusion in modern browsers around 2022 and has been gaining traction for its utility in refining user experience.

The `overscroll-inline` property helps manage the behavior when a user scrolls past the end of a scrollable container in the inline direction, which is typically horizontal in left-to-right reading formats. It's especially useful in combination with directional writing modes, offering more granular control over how overflow is handled.

In a typical scenario, you might want to restrict overscrolling to offer a more controlled experience or, conversely, allow it to offer a smooth, momentum-like scroll effect. This is where `overscroll-inline` shines, as it can be set to values such as `auto`, `contain`, or `none`.

- `auto`: This is the default behavior, where overscrolling is permitted and will allow the content to bounce or glow depending on the user agent.
- `contain`: Disallows all overscroll past the edge of the scrollable area.
- `none`: Disables overscrolling completely, similar to scroll containment, but can be more efficient.

Here's a simple example illustrating its use:

```css
.container {
  overflow-x: scroll;
  overscroll-inline: contain;
}
```
In this code snippet, the containerâ€™s overscroll is contained, meaning users cannot scroll past the end of the horizontal content, preventing the "rubber band" effect often seen in mobile browsers.

The practical utility of `overscroll-inline` today is significant, particularly in web applications with intricate UIs requiring careful control over user interactions. It enhances the user experience by providing consistency and predictability. In responsive designs or applications mimicking native behavior, utilizing `overscroll-inline` allows tailoring the interface more closely to native app standards.

However, developers must be mindful of its browser support. Being a relatively new addition, `overscroll-inline` enjoys varying degrees of support across browsers. As of now, it's well-supported in Chrome, Edge, and Firefox, but developers should verify its presence by testing on browsers and considering fallback strategies for those lacking support. Always use feature queries to ensure broader compatibility:

```css
@supports (overscroll-inline: contain) {
  .container {
    overscroll-inline: contain;
  }
}
```

In conclusion, by incorporating `overscroll-inline`, developers can leverage fine-grained control to boost user interaction quality and build sophisticated, responsive designs that delight users across devices.

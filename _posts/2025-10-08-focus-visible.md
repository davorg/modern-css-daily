The CSS pseudo-class `:focus-visible` is a powerful tool for web developers looking to improve accessibility and user experience on their sites. Introduced as a Working Draft by the CSS Working Group in 2018, the concept of `:focus-visible` emerged to address a nuanced user interface issue: the indiscriminate highlighting of focused elements that may not always provide a beneficial user experience.

The `:focus-visible` pseudo-class allows developers to apply styles specifically to elements that should show a focus indicator when they receive focus, without relying on global outline rules. It functions by distinguishing specific circumstances under which focus indicators should be visible, such as when a user navigates via keyboard. This provides a way for developers to manage focus styles more intelligently and produce a cleaner interface, especially for those who primarily use mouse or touch input.

Example usage of `:focus-visible` could look as follows:

```css
button:focus {
  outline: none;
}

button:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid blue;
}
```

In this code, focus is suppressed on buttons unless the focus is reached through keyboard navigation or other accessibility tools that suggest focus styling is necessary, such as screen readers. 

The utility of `:focus-visible` is evident in its ability to cater to both accessibility needs and aesthetic considerations. Many web interfaces that exclusively use `:focus` run the risk of triggering outline styles whenever an element receives focus, which can be frequent in mouse-driven interactions. This often leads to designers removing focus styles entirely, thus excluding keyboard users, like those who navigate using the "Tab" key, from essential accessibility cues. With `:focus-visible`, the focus outline remains invisible in regular mouse usage unless explicitly interacting in a manner that indicates accessibility needs.

Despite its advantages, developers should be aware of certain caveats. While `:focus-visible` has broad browser support, it's worthwhile to check for compatibility across different environments. As of late 2023, support is robust in modern versions of Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. However, as with any newer feature, checking specific version support can save headaches. For browsers that do not support `:focus-visible`, strategies like using JavaScript polyfills or adhering to a progressive enhancement approach can help ensure baseline accessibility and style consistency.

The introduction of `:focus-visible` is a significant step towards more inclusive web design, balancing the needs of accessibility without compromising on visual elegance. It empowers developers to create intuitive and navigable web experiences for all users.

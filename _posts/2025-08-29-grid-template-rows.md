The "grid-template-rows" property in CSS is a game-changer for developers looking to create more structured and manageable layouts. Introduced in CSS Grid Layout Module Level 1, which became widely available in major browsers around 2017, this feature empowered developers to move beyond hacky floats and flexbox tricks to manage complex webpage layouts more efficiently.

At its core, "grid-template-rows" defines the number and size of the rows in a grid container. It allows you to specify how much space each row should take up, whether they're fixed in size, dynamically responsive, or a combination of the two. This property transforms a grid container into a structured layout, providing a more intuitive way to organize content than older layout methods.

Let's dive into a practical example: 

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: 100px 200px auto;
}
```
In this example, a grid container is established with three rows. The first row has a fixed height of 100 pixels, the second row 200 pixels, and the last row takes up the remaining available space in the grid container. You can also use the "repeat" function for repetitive patterns or "minmax" to define flexible minimum and maximum sizes, further enhancing the versatility of this property.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 1fr) minmax(150px, auto);
}
```
In this scenario, the first two rows equally take any available space as indicated by "1fr" (fractional unit), and the third row adjusts between 150 pixels and additional flexible space as needed.

The utility of "grid-template-rows" today is substantial. Web developers can now design highly responsive and adaptable layouts without the need for extensive media queries. By defining explicit row sizes, developers gain precision control over their designs, making them more predictable and easier to manage. This approach leads to cleaner, more maintainable code.

However, there are considerations to keep in mind. While browser support has significantly improved, with Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge offering full support for CSS Grid Layout, older versions and some less common browsers may not provide the same compatibility. Testing across different environments using tools like Autoprefixer or considering fallback styles ensures broader accessibility.

In summary, "grid-template-rows" provides an elegant solution to modern layout challenges, reducing complexity and improving design consistency. Its adaptability and precise control over row management make it as relevant today as when it was first introduced, paving the way for more dynamic and responsive web experiences.

The CSS scroll-snap feature has become a staple for web developers looking for precise control over scrolling behavior. Introduced in the CSS Scroll Snap Module Level 1, which became a Candidate Recommendation in mid-2018, this utility has been a boon for creating smooth and predictable scroll interactions on both desktop and mobile devices.

Scroll snapping allows developers to define specific positions where scrolling should stop, closely mirroring the functionality often seen in mobile app interfaces. This can be particularly advantageous for galleries, carousels, or any layout where you want the user to focus on one element at a time as they scroll.

To leverage scroll-snap, you need to familiarize yourself with a few key properties: `scroll-snap-type`, `scroll-snap-align`, and `scroll-padding`. Here’s a brief example to illustrate how these work together:

```css
.container {
  overflow: auto;
  scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;
  display: flex;
}

.child {
  scroll-snap-align: start;
  width: 100%; /* or any desired width */
  flex: 0 0 auto;
}
```

In this snippet, the container is set to horizontally snap to elements. The `scroll-snap-type: x mandatory;` ensures that the scroll stops precisely at each element’s start, as defined by `scroll-snap-align: start;`. This setup is great for horizontal carousels where each child element should be fully visible upon scroll.

The utility of scroll snapping in modern web design cannot be overstated. By providing a more predictable and controlled user experience, it can significantly enhance the usability of a site. It's especially beneficial for mobile experiences where finger gestures control scroll, making actions less jittery and more satisfying.

However, despite its widespread utility, it's essential to be aware of a few caveats related to scroll-snap. While support for scroll snap is extensive across modern browsers, some older versions might not fully recognize these properties. As of my last available data in October 2023, all major browsers like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge have robust implementation of scroll snapping, but it’s wise to test across your target demographics.

Moreover, the exact behavior might vary slightly, especially considering "mandatory" snapping versus "proximity" snapping – the latter being a bit more flexible and less strict. 

In summary, with scroll-snap, CSS developers have a powerful tool for creating intuitive scrolling interfaces that align with user expectations and enhance navigational efficiency. As web design continues to blur the lines between desktop and mobile, such features become foundational to a unified, coherent approach to user interaction design.

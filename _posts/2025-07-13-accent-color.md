Introduced in late 2021, the `accent-color` CSS property presents an exciting evolution for styling web interfaces by allowing developers to modify the appearance of form controls and more with ease. This property is part of the user's interface styling routine and is particularly useful in customizing elements such as checkboxes, radio buttons, and other controls that traditionally had a system-native appearance, meaning they were hard to customize without heavy overrides or JavaScript interventions.

The `accent-color` property allows developers to specify a specific color theme for elements that users interact with, injecting a unified design language without the hassle of overriding default styles. This property accepts any valid CSS color value, such as named colors, HEX codes, RGB, and HSL. The beauty of `accent-color` is that with a single line of code, you can create a consistent and visually coherent theme for interactive elements.

Consider this practical example to demonstrate how `accent-color` is employed:

```css
body {
  --main-accent-color: #ff6347;
}

input[type="checkbox"],
input[type="radio"] {
  accent-color: var(--main-accent-color);
}
```

In this snippet, we use a CSS variable to define the main accent color (a shade of tomato) and apply it to both checkbox and radio button inputs. With this approach, the checkboxes and radio buttons will adopt this color scheme, delivering a consistent appearance aligned with your brand's palette. This reduces the need for custom graphics or JavaScript functionality to achieve the same outcome, simplifying the codebase and ensuring cross-browser functionalities.

The usefulness of `accent-color` today lies in its ability to enhance accessibility while adhering to design aesthetics. Because it piggybacks on existing form controls, it fully supports the rich accessibility features baked into native elements, such as keyboard navigability and screen reader support. Thus, it ensures your designs remain user-friendly across different devices and assistive technologies.

However, before adopting `accent-color` into your workflow, it is crucial to acknowledge its compatibility caveats. As of October 2023, most modern browsers, such as Chrome, Edge, Firefox, and Safari, support `accent-color`. Yet, developers should still verify compatibility with their target audience, especially if the audience predominately uses older browser versions or underrepresented platforms. 

In summary, `accent-color` is a great addition to the modern CSS toolkit, helping developers effortlessly achieve consistent, accessible design themes across form elements. It exemplifies how CSS continues to evolve, offering finer control with less complexity and fostering a more integrated design process for the web.

Every year I take the [State of CSS](https://stateofcss.com/en-US) survey.

And every year, I'm reminded that the vast majority of my CSS knowledge is
stuck somewhere in the early 2000s. The only reason that my websites look
vaguely acceptable is because I use a theme or (more often than not)
[Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

After taking the 2025 survey, and realising I'd heard of almost none of the
features they asked about, I decided to do something about it. And with the
help of [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/),
[Minimal Mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/),
[the OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/) and a bit of
[Perl code](https://github.com/davorg/modern-css-daily/blob/main/bin/generate_post)
to glue it all together, I built this site.

Each day, we'll have a new article about a CSS feature that has been added
since I stopped taking notice about twenty years ago. There's an RSS feed for
those of you old enough to remember web feeds.

I built this purely for me. But I guess there's a good chance that others
might be in the same situation. Let me know if you find it useful too.

Cheers,
